# About me
Hi! <br />
My name is Grant, I am 19 years old. <br />
Coding and being creative through coding has been my personal passion as soon as I started it. It is very important and special to me.
Around 6 years ago I started getting very interested in computer networking. Since then I have been learning anything and everything I can about coding with my skillsets.
<br />
### Get to know my developer personality
- If a task should be automated, it will be
- If code should be modulated, it will be
- I only request help or a peer review when I am completely stumped, or have an exhausting mental block
- I am mainly self taught
- I can take an idea and put it into code as long as its understood
- I take pride in my work being original
- I am very adaptable to different coding environments and people.
