# About me
Hello 👋 I'm Grant <br />
I develop full scale L3-L7 network structures for Linux. Currently I have been studying Cryptography and network to OS versatility for developing custom protocols.
<br />

# My skillset ✅

### Programming Languages 🖥️
- **Lang**: My use for it
- **C**: Anything and everything low-level, network and protocol development, experimental cryptography, logic algorithms
- **Go (Golang)**: Usually used for more advanced and versatile frontends for the C APIs
- **Python**: On demand throwaway scripts for automation
- **SQL**: In conjuction with C and GoLang 
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Very brief history with web development and design, and beginner react development with a node js environment

### Systems & Networking 🤖
- **Linux Development**: Currently only skilled with userspace development
- **Low-Level Networking**: Using, creating, and structuring  L3-L4 and L7 protocols
- **Network Security**: Bit by bit protocol analysis, packet inspection, and vulnerability assessment

### Security & Testing 🔒
- **Penetration Testing**: Non-active environments pentested with burp suite, any toolchain can be learned quick.
- **Cryptographic Implementations**: Secure, unique, and versatile algorithm design

### Performance & Optimization ⏰
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimized algorithms, memory management
- **Low-Level Programming mindset**: Efficient resource utilization, low-level optimization
- **Byte level optimizations**: I am phenomenal at deciding how to process binary data efficiently
  
### Misc skills 🧠
- **Improvising logic algorithms**
- **Project file structure management and creation**
- **Api implementation**: Implementing an API through it's documentation is second hand
- **TUI Design**: Great experience with creating TUIs using ASCII

# 💡 My Development Principles

* **Automation first** – Any repeatable task gets a script or CI pipeline.  
* **Modularity matters** – I keep libraries loosely coupled and well‑documented.  
* **Peer review is a safety net** – I only skip it when I truly hit a dead‑end and have a clear fallback plan.  
* **Originality with scrutiny** – I design algorithms from scratch, then benchmark against standards.  
* **Learn‑by‑doing** – I pick a language, build a tiny project, and iterate.

# Weaknesses
### Theres always room for improvement. Where does that reside with me?
- I have barely any experience actively coding with other people on the same project
- I Can never maintain a perfect schema on big projects
- I get burnt out when coding for a long time in one day
- I sometimes demotivate myself when working on projects because of the sheer scale
- If a peers feedback isn't an obvious improvement I am more likely to disregard it
