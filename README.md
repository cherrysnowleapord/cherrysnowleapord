# About me
Hi! 
My name is Grant, I am 19 years old. 
Around 6 years ago I started getting very interested in computer networking. Since then I have been learning anything and everything I can about developing around my skillsets.

### Get to know my developer personality
- If a task should be automated, it will be
- If code should be modulated, it will be
- I always do my own research and intel before requesting help
- I am mainly self taught
- I take pride in my work being original
- I am very adaptable to different coding environments and people.
